# RADOMIR FUGIEL 

## To run:

Spin up the server with:
flask run dev

Run the frontend with:
npm run dev

(First install dependencies with npm install and pip install -r requirements.txt)

NOTES:
Just to get it working I had the auth bearer roken stored clientside with localStorage and then sent in the requests to the flasp backend.
I would do this differently. I would also update the UI maybe use bootstrap at least, and then def some minor changes. What I have suffices. Perhaps if not reviewed by monday afternoon I'll submit some improvements, otherwise this is my submission.
